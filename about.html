                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p>
                    I began my journey with competitive programming and gradually
                    transitioned into web development and open source.
                    I enjoy building real world applications and continuously learning.
                </p>

                <br><br>

                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <br>

                <h3>Open Source Contributions</h3><br>
                    <p>I have contributed to open source projects including Servo and Zulip, where I worked on small but
                    meaningful fixes related to build warnings and test stability. Through these contributions I gained
                    experience with large Rust codebases, CI workflows, code reviews, and good Git practices.
                    This was my first time contributing to a massive open source project,and it helped me
                    understand real world collaboration and engineering standards. I am continuing to explore open
                    source
                    and improve with each contribution.</p>

                <h3>OOTD-Generator</h3><br>
                    <p>OOTD is a client side outfit recommendation web application built using HTML CSS and vanilla
                    JavaScript. It allows users to upload clothing images across three categories and generates two
                    outfit combinations dynamically using structured JavaScript logic. The project uses DOM manipulation
                    array based wardrobe management and localStorage for state persistence across multiple pages. The
                    layout is built using CSS Grid for overall structure and Flexbox for component alignment with
                    responsive design and dark mode support. The focus was to combine clean frontend architecture with
                    interactive UI and structured recommendation logic.</p>
                <br>
               <h3>Tic Tac Toe Game</h3><br>
                     <p>I built a Tic Tac Toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as one of my first frontend
                    projects. Through this project, I learned event handling, basic game logic
                    implementation, and state management in vanilla JavaScript. It helped me understand how user
                    interactions translate into dynamic UI updates in a browser environment.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Currency Converter</h3><br>
                    <p>I developed a simple currency converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to strengthen my
                    understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and API integration. This project helped me practice
                    working with asynchronous requests, handling user input, and updating the UI dynamically based on
                    real-time data. It marked an important step in my transition from learning syntax to building
                    functional web applications.</p>
