                <h2>Starting From Zero</h2>
                <p>When I joined college, I had absolutely no idea about coding I did not know a single programming
                    language,I did not understand what development meant. Just like many other juniors, I followed what
                    my seniors suggested.They told me to start with competitive programming. So I did.</p>
                <p>At first,
                    competitive programming felt exciting. Every problem I solved felt like a small win. It boosted my
                    confidence. It improved my logic and problem solving skills it made me feel like this is something
                    every serious coder has to do. But the truth was I jumped into it without really being prepared. I
                    was learning the programming language, logic, and complex problem statements all at the same time.
                    God there were literal times when I could not even explain why a solution worked,it just did and I
                    was just trying to keep up. Still, I kept practicing. I joined contests. I solved problems daily. I
                    compared my progress with others and it many a times used to make me feel down,because everyone
                    seemed to either do better or just was more efficient,that feeling kept me motivated, I fought
                    back,harder and harder each time.Eventually, I reached a two star rating on CodeChef and crossed
                    950+ on Codeforces. For someone who had started from zero, that meant a lot and it gave me a million
                    butterflies in my stomach But then, after somewhile,no matter how much I pushed or solved or
                    practiced I started feeling tired rather than progressing even slightly.</p>
                <p> Competitive programming
                    began to feel like a race where everyone was running in the same direction. Even though it helped my
                    thinking, I could not imagine doing this forever,that feeling of being able to sit infront of my
                    laptop with the sense of spirit in the back of my head,no,I never ever felt that when I was doing
                    competitive programming and that's when I knew that this is forced,forced upon me by me,the less
                    exposure and the rat race I was in.</p>
                <p>And I knew that if I continued only because everyone else was
                    doing it, I would eventually burn out and never reach anywhere close to what I dreamt off.</p>


                <h2>
                    Learning to Choose My Own Path in Tech
                </h2>
                <p>It took me some time to understand that trying to fit in was not really making me happy or feel
                    content with what I am doing There was always that invisible pressure in college to do what everyone
                    else was doing,be it to following the same path to "liking" the same things. And honestly, it was
                    very hard to ignore that pressure. So for a long time, I just went along with things even when they
                    did not feel right. I forced myself into activities and programs just because that felt
                    normal.."what everyone is doing must be bcoz it's right" that felt easier than questioning
                    everything.</p>
                <p>But somewhere along the way, I started asking myself a simple question: What do I actually like? And
                    not what I should like and what feels right to me. This shift did not happen suddenly. It was slow
                    like very slow. It happened when I started saying no to things that drained me and yes to things
                    that made me curious, even if they felt small or random.</p>

                <p>And that change felt freeing. I realized that it is okay to find your own space.</p>
                <h2>
                    Discovering Development
                </h2>
                <p>That is when I started exploring development.It felt very different and unique, It felt like my
                    finally boring black and white life gave me some colours to play with Instead of solving abstract
                    problems, I was building things I could actually see and use. That change felt refreshing. It felt
                    real. I still remember creating a silly goofy totally useless webpage and lord that feeling of
                    clicking on the live server button and seeing something that I can proudly say "I BUILT THIS". That
                    felt ethereal to me It clicked to me like a perfect key to a lock!!</p>

                <p>Then I started exploring the different domains of web development.I tried app development at first,
                    but it did not really settle with me. Web development, however, felt natural and tingled something
                    inside me.Designing layouts was calming,watching things come together on the screen felt satisfying
                    in a way competitive programming never ever did for me I genuinely enjoyed it. Working on both
                    frontend and backend helped me understand how things work behind the scenes. Concepts like APIs,
                    databases, and UI decisions started making sense in a practical way. It was no longer just theory.
                    It was something I could build and experiment with. At the same time, web development felt
                    overwhelming. There are so many tools, frameworks, and opinions everywhere. Everyone seems to be
                    following a different path.</p>
                <p>Starting from scratch in such a huge space can feel confusing. This time, advice from seniors, peers,
                    and mentors helped a lot because I deep down,knew that I can and that I want to work in this
                    sector,They reminded me that it is okay to take time. It is okay to explore slowly. It is okay not
                    to have everything figured out.That reassurance made all the difference.</p>


                <h2>Entering Open Source</h2>
                <p>During this exploration, I found open source. Initially, it felt scary. Large codebases. Unfamiliar
                    setups. Experienced contributors. I genuinely did not understand how beginners even start. So I
                    started small. I asked questions. I made mistakes. I asked more questions. With help from seniors
                    and peers, things slowly started making sense.</p>
                <p>Recently when I got my first PR merged,my in an global organization, I was over the moon!! And that
                    experience taught me lessons no tutorial ever could how to read other people’s code, how to
                    communicate clearly, how to be patient, and how to accept feedback. It was intimidating, very
                    intimidating I might add but it was also empowering and captivated me very much. Around the same
                    time, I started exploring programs like GSoC, Summer of Bitcoin and C4GT. I learned how to find
                    organizations on my own, understand their tech stacks, and prepare accordingly.</p>
                <p>Instead of blindly following what others were doing, I started researching and building skills
                    intentionally. That felt like growth.</p>


                <h2>Building Something of My Own</h2>
                <p>One project I am currently working on is my personal project called the OOTD platform. It came from a
                    very simple problem we all face often which is, we all have those few pieces of clothings in our
                    wardrobe that we bought thousands of years ago and now have no clue how to style all of them
                    together.</p>

                <p>The platform I created allows users to upload pictures of their uppers, bottoms, and footwear, and
                    then suggests outfit combinations with some impeccable vibe notes!! It may sound small, but building
                    it has helped me apply everything I learned in web development in a practical way.</p>
                <p>I really want to work upon it even more, I am planning to add a thrifting service available ,where
                    registered users can chat and can put up their clothes for thrifting, I am yet to work on this
                    section but yes this is not just a tutorial project. It is something very close to me that I have
                    literally built from scratch. And that makes it meaningful.</p>

                <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
                <p>Right now, I am still learning. Still exploring. Still consistent and that keeps me going always,the
                    sense of all of this! My journey has not been straight. I moved from trying to fit in, to
                    competitive programming, to development, to open source, to personal projects.</p>
                <p>But every phase taught me something important. Competitive programming taught me discipline and
                    logic. Development taught me creativity and creation. Open source taught me collaboration and
                    patience. And stepping away from fitting in taught me self awareness.</p>
                <p>For the first time after coming to college, I feel like I am not chasing something just because
                    everyone else is. I am exploring because I am curious.And honestly, I am finally enjoying the
                    process and to me that matters the most!</p>
